\section{指标定理}
index theorem:

Symplectic case: $(X,\omg)$ symplectic mfd,
$P=\omg^{-1}$

Fedosov: a single geometric way
to get deformation quantization and the classification by
$$\omg_{\hbar}=-\omg+\hbar\omg_1+\hbar^2\omg_2+\cdots$$
where
$$\omg_i\in H^2(X,\bbR)$$

\begin{definition}
 the trace map
$$\tau: c^{\infty}(X)\to \bbR\Ls{\hbar}$$
satisfying
$$\tau(f\star g)=\tau(g\star f)$$
$$\Longrightarrow \tau\in \HH^0(C^{\infty}(x)\fps{\hbar})$$

Fedosov/Nest Tsygar: canonical trace

such that
$$\tau(f)=\frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^n}
\int_X
  \frac{\omg^n}{n!}
  (f+O(\hbar))$$
\end{definition}

注意记号：
$$\HH^i(A):=H^i(A,A^*)$$


\begin{thm}(Fedosov/Nest-Tsygan)

$$\tau(1)=\int_X e^{w_{\hbar}/\hbar}\Ahat(X)$$
(algebraic index thm)
where $\Ahat$ is the genus of $X$,
$$\Ahat(X):=
\det\nolimits^{1/2}\frac{R/2}{\sinh(R/2)}$$
$R$ is the curvature of $T_X$.
\end{thm}

Goal: explain both 1 and 2 from

non-commutative Hochschild theory

quantum- field theory

\section{$\phi^4$重整化}
\begin{example}Quantum mechanics (QFT in dimension 1)

field:
$$\gamma:\bbR\to\text{a space}$$
$$t\mapsto \gamma(t)$$

$$\mcalS[\gma]=\frac{1}{2}\int\bbR\td t|\gma'(t)|^2$$
is called energy...

\end{example}

"Physics fact": For $x,y\in\bbR^d$,consider
$$\int_{\gma:[0,t]\to\bbR^d\atop\gma(0)=x,\quad\gma(t)=y}
[D\gma]e^{-\mcalS[\gma]/\hbar}
=h_t(x,y)$$

"the second story":first order formula,
$$\mcalS\to\mcalS[\cdots]$$

还是下一节课再讲吧。。。

%%%%%%%%%%这是dGBV代数的一个例子%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Calabi-Yau流形与dGBV}
下一个例子来自复几何，与Hodge理论、形变理论联系密切。

\begin{example}%Let $X$ be a complex manifold of complex dimension $d$,
设$X$为$d$维复流形，
$$\Omg\in H^0(X,K_X)$$
is a holomorphic volume form(nowhere vanishing),where
$K_X:=\wedgeform{d}T_X^{1,0}$

Then $(X,\Omg)$ is called a CY manifold(Calabi-Yau).

$$\PV^{p,q}(X):=\Omg^{p,q}(X,\wedgeform{p}T_X^{1,0})
\xra{\suobing\Omg}\Omg^{d-p,q}(X)$$

$$\pbar:\PV^{p,q}\to\PV^{p,q-1}$$
$$\yc:\PV^{p,q}\to\PV^{p-1,q}$$
\end{example}
Then we have a DGBV:
$$\mcalA:=\PV^{\bullet,\bullet}(X)$$
$$Q:=\pbar$$
$$\yc=\text{divergence}$$

(Hodge theory,deformation theory)

$$\deg\PV^{p,q}(X)=q-p$$

\section{$\mathsf{A}_n$-型奇点}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%作为量子QME的一个例子%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example}
$f(z)=z^{n+1}$,($A_n$-singularity),
$$Jac(f)=\bbC[z]\big/z^n$$
$$\mu=n$$
\end{example}

Check:
$$Obs^q\cong\Omg_{holo}^n\fps{\hbar}\big/
(\hbar\td+\td f\wedge)$$
called (formal) Brieshorn lattice.

$Obs^q$ describes complex oscillatory integral.

Rmk: Singularity leads to a mixed Hodge theory.

$\hbar=$Hodge filtration.

QFT is a $\infty$-dimensional version of Hodge theory.
